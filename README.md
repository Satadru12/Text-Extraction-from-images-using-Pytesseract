# Text-Extraction-from-images-using-Pytesseract
Classification of Bills


We used pytessaract to extract the text from the images of bills. We then labelled them in their respective categories.
After that we preprocessed the text using TFIDF and Truncated SVD. We then applied 5 ML models on the data to classify 
the bills into their respective categories.
